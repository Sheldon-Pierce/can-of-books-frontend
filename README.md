How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

- We will help each other through the process regardless of specific skills, weaknesses, and strengths

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Backend integration for apps.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

- navigating and driving will help us keep in sync. Though we will review our code to cement understanding. We'll make good and frequent comments

## Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- give that person driver responsibility or otherwise have them help the team

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

- have the person doing all the work incorporate the others

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Be patient and talk things out. Make sure to bring the team with you by walking through the code and answering questions.
